You may switch on the news and be told of an awful atrocity, a callous crime or be shown examples of greed, poverty or the latest animal that's just become extinct. You'll sit there and your main takeaway will be how much evil there is in the world.

Getinspired365 offers you an escape from all of that. It presents an alternative reality. A reality that is actually just that - reality. It's devoid of politics and its only agenda is to try to inspire you in someway. Getinspired365 is packed full of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. 

The news should be stories of heroism and not of cowardness. Why not learn about people who climb mountains and row oceans who actually are just like you and I? Why not listen to an interview of someone who's overcome adversity, who can show you that maybe, just maybe, you can too. Want to improve yourself? Want to think more openly? Want to believe there's more good than bad in the world? If so, this site is for you. Switch off the news, escape the negativity and get inspired 365 days a year.

This site was built and curated by Mike Doyle and Steve Whyley after Steve decided to take on a running challenge that he was ill equipped to achieve! Needing inspiration, Mike sent him some videos of people achieving seemingly impossible things to try and help him complete the challenge. Steve came to rely on these videos and so we decided to create a site that featured 100s of them! All carefully selected to try and help you achieve some sort of goal. Not content with just videos, we have dug out inspiring stories from across the web and have also sat down with people who are also taking on their own challenges, and found out how they go about achieving the impossible. 

We'd love for you to get in touch and let us know if there are features or content you'd like to see! 

For now, we'll leave you with our favourite quote:
