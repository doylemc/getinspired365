title: "If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced."
author: "Vincent Van Gogh"
description: "If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced. - Vincent Van Gogh quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Paint, pastel, paper. Silk screen and block print. Digital art and photography. Pen and pencil. Collage and clay. All were employed to help us illustrate the words of Vincent van Gogh. We invite you to ignore that inner critic who says, 'you cannot' because it is through any medium and by all means that art is created.  Thank you to each and every one of these artists for silencing the voice within that says, 'you cannot' and for sharing their work with all of us."
