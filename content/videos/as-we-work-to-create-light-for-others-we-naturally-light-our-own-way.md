summary: "Mark Bustos works full-time at a boutique salon, where prices start at $150. On Sunday, his only day off, Mark goes out onto the streets of New York City and gives free haircuts to the homeless. He thinks everybody is capable of a little kindness and after watching this itâ€™s hard to disagree. "
