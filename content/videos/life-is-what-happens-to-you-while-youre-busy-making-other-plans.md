description: "Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans. - John Lennon quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "This video perfectly illustrates John Lennon's famous quote. Many of us want a peaceful life and to be able to enjoy the present moment but we seem unable to do that as we are forever making future plans so we feel secure, or chasing that next promotion so we finally have enough money to live the life that we want to live. Lennon doesn’t say we shouldn’t make plans, far from it, but that the true experience of being alive is beyond those plans, and “happens” to us."
