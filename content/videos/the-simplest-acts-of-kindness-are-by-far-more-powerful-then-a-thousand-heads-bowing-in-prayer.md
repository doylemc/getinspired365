summary: "What makes Emily unique is that by age three her golden [brown] locks were long enough to be made into a wig for a child with cancer. As Emily states in the video, 'just cut some off and give it to a kid'. What an incredible lesson to learn from a 3 year old, when we have lots of something - don't hold onto it, give it away to someone else who needs it more."
