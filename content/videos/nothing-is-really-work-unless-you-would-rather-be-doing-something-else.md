description: "Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else. - J.M. Barrie quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Mark Rober was able to work on NASA JPLâ€™s Curiosity Mars Rover for 7 years. This video is an attempt to capture what it felt like to have 7 years of your life vindicated in the 7 minute landing. All the pictures of hardware you see in the video are things that he worked on designing or testing or building."
