summary: "A video from DiyMike 'For years, one of the goals of mine was always to provide my mother with something she worked so hard for and lost. Las Vegas was one of the hardest hit city in the economic downturn, and my mother ended up losing her home.

Its been a long time coming and I just wanted to share this special moment with you.'"
