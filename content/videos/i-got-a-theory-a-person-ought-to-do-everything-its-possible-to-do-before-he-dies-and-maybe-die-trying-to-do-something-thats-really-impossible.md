summary: "WATERisLIFE, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing safe water to communities around the world, has launched a bittersweet video to promote its mission. The group travels to Kenya — where safe drinking water is scarce — & introduces us to 4-year-old Nkaitole. Nikaitole has a 1 in 5 chance of passing away before he turns five, due to unsafe drinking conditions.  Because of this harrowing statistic, the organization films the young boy checking off his bucket list."
