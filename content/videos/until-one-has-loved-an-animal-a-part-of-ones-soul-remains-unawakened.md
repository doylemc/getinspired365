description: "Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened. - Anatole France quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "This is a story about a boy and his dog. But not just any boy, and not just any dog. Owen suffers from an incredibly rare genetic disease which causes him great pain. His dog, Haatchi has three legs. Their remarkable bond keeps the two of them pushing forward and this video is perhaps the most touching we've ever shared here at GI365."
