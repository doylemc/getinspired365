author: "Muhammad Ali"
description: "He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life. - Muhammad Ali quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "This is a tribute to the greatest sportsman who ever lived. We loved Ali both because he did things we never could and shared our flaws too. Never an angel, always an inspiration; both real and unreal. Don King was known for his hyperbole but for once he got it right when he remarked that Ali will 'never die...because his spirit will go on forever.' Getinspired365 was created because of people like Ali - people who inspired others into thinking that anything was possible. "
