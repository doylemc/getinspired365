summary: "Marina Abramovic presented a 736-hour piece called The Artist Is Present, in which she remained seated at a table in NYC's Museum of Modern Art, inviting spectators to come & sit opposite her. On opening night, her long-lost former lover Ulay surprised her. The pair hadn’t seen one another since they ended their love affair in the ’70s by walking the length of China’s Great Wall and meeting in the middle for a final embrace. This video shows their reaction at seeing each other one last time."
