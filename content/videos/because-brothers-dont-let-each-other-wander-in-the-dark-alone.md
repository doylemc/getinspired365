description: "Because brothers don’t let each other wander in the dark alone. - Jolene Perry quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Conner Long is 9 years old and his little brother Cayden is 7. They are from Tennessee and both love sports.  However, only one of them can participate in sports.  The difference is that Cayden has cerebral palsy and is unable to walk or talk on his own. As a good big brother, Conner was looking for a way to help his younger sibling to get involved in sports with him so that he could feel the thrill of participation.  Connor had an idea for a sport they could both participate in - triathlons! "
