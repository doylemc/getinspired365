summary: "'I've always enjoyed helping others, and after being in discussions with Make A Wish foundation for a while, decided I wanted my wish with them to be to 'spread my story and positivity with as many people as possible'. To make this happen, we made this film. I thoroughly hope you enjoy the video, and hope you can help out by sharing it with as many people as possible!'"
