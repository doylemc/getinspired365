title: "“Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”"

summary: "Today's video encapsulates the bravery and kindess of individuals who are caught up in a terrorist attack. Yesterday London suffered such an attack. Tobias Ellwood MP - whose brother died in the Bali terrorist bombing in 2002 - was among those who rushed to help and attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of injured PC Palmer. There are countless stories like these and it is these stories that we want to focus on today."
