summary: "'My name is Hector Picard, and I recently cycled across the USA for a baby's future prosthetic arms - 'Hands for Baby Jameson'. I accomplished my goal of cycling 3050 miles in 36 days and raised with your generous contributions a little over $20,000. My goal was to raise over $33,000; and since reaching Spokane, Washington on July 13th, I've been trying to find a unique way of reaching that goal. Therefore, I created this video, 'Changing a Bicycle Flat Tire Without Hands'. "
