description: "Remember, you can learn just as much from your children as they can learn from you. - Suli Breaks quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Suli touches on his experiences as a young adult attempting to purse his success, and the negativity that he and so many other experience from their parents as a result of this. He comments on the borderline hypocritical attitude that it's sometimes adopted that does not allow a child to flourish outside of the constraints of the society which their parents have subjected them to."
