summary: "'A Message from Jared Leto: I'm sitting in the dark writing this having just finished this little film and although I don't feel quite done yet it's time to let it go. This is a story about an incredible adventure that we all shared together this summer. A summer that we will never forget. It's also a reminder (for myself as well) to LIVE LIFE NO MATTER WHAT. But ultimately it's a love letter to you all. The believers.'"
