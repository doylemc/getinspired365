summary: "Widely recognized as the best slopestyle mountain biker in the world, Brandon Semenuk has become the first biker to film a full segment in a single continuous shot. This shot was filmed by the most advanced gyro-stabilized camera system, the GSS C520, mounted to a truck on a custom road built next to a custom trail that took weeks to build. This cinematic achievement required perfect coordination between Semenuk, Anthill Films, & TGR with regard to athleticism, planning, timing & logistics."
