summary: "The Holstee Manifesto is a call to action to live a life full of intention, creativity, passion, and community. The LifeCycle Film came about as a desire to bring the energy and passion behind the Manifesto to life through something we love--biking. As we seek to live mindful lifestyles that leave a positive impact on the people and world around us, biking has become a passion that is much more than a transportation alternative"
