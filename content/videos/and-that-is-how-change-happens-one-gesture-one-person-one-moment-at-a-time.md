summary: "Programmer Patrick McConlogue gave the homeless Leo Grand two options â€“ 'Either I give you $100 right now that you can spend in any way you want. Or, I will come back with a latpop and teach you how to code.' Leo went for option number two, and this is his inspiring story on what happened next."
