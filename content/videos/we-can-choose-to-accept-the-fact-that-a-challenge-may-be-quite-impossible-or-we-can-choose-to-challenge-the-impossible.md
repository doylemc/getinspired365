summary: "This is the inspirational success story of Jennifer Bricker. She is an American acrobat and aerialist. She is the sister of gymnast Dominique Moceanu. Born without legs, she was placed for adoption by her parents. She was a featured performer on the Britney Spears “Circus” tour and was the first handicapped high school tumbling champion in the state of Illinois. The moral is clear – give something your all and follow your dream despite any setbacks you may suffer along the way."
