summary: "Today is the London Marathon and the team at GI365 wish all the runners the best of luck! The fact these individuals have made it to the start line and willing to put their body on the line for a greater cause is incredibly inspiring and seeing all the varying ages and abilities it proves that we are all capable of anything should we put our minds to it."
