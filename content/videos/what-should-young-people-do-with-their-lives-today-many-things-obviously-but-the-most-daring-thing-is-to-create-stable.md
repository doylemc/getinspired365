description: "What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured. - Kurt Vonnegut quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "When you spend all day coaching Little League, teaching ballet, feeding the hungry, building bike trails, or planting the community garden only to hear people turn around and diss your hometown, you're bound to get a little annoyed. But when the people who work like mad behind the scenes to make Camden, N.J., a great place to live got tired of reading and hearing negative things about their city all the time, they didn't get angry. They just decided to make a little music."
