summary: "Ira Glass, longtime host of radio program 'This American Life,' shared some insightful advice from his own life experiences on overcoming self-doubt. He presents 'The Gap'. That disparity between early career output and a persons potential. Everyone experiences that 'Taste' between the quality they are creating and what they would like to create. Glass' two minute video provides inspiration and a reminder that experience is the only way to close that gap."
