summary: "Ask yourself. What would you do with your life if money was no object? An amazing lecture from the late Alan Watts. Alan challenges us to ask ourselves what it is we desire. What is our passion? If we can become master’s of passion then we can earn a living through this. It’s a great reminder that we spend so much time at work – it would be an awful shame if we didn’t enjoy that time. Alan Watts audio courtesy of alanwatts.org."
