summary: "For decades, high school teacher Bruce Farrer has been asking his students to write letters to their future selves. Twenty years later, he tracks down the students – wherever they are in the world – and mails their letters to them. The impact he has had on his students’ lives is profound and heartwarming. We love people who go beyond and we hope Bruce inspires you to go that extra step. The video was put together by WestJet."
