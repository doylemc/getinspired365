summary: "October 14, 2012, Felix Baumgartner ascended more than 24 miles above Earth's surface to the edge of space in a stratospheric balloon. Millions across the globe watched as he opened the door of the capsule, stepped off the platform, and broke the speed of sound while free falling safely back to Earth. Felix set three world records that dayâ€”and inspired us all to reach beyond the limits of our own realities, and reimagine our potential to achieve the incredible."
