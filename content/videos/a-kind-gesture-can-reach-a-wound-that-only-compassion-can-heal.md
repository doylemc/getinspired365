description: "A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. - Steve Maraboli quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Jose Antonio had been living on the streets of the Majorcan capital, Palma, for 25 years, working as an 'unlicensed car park attendant' to make money to buy food. As years passed his hair had turned grey and he had grown an unkempt beard. One of the 55-year-old's regular customers was the owner of La Salvajeria salon and he invited Mr Antonio to have his hair done. His grey hair and immense beard were trimmed, tidied & dyed black, turning him from dishevelled homeless man into stylish hipster."
