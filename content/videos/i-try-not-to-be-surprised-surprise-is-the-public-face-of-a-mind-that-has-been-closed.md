summary: "Abandoned in an orphanage at the age of three, Choi claims that he ran away from the institution when he was 5 years old because of having been beaten. He lived in stairwells and public washrooms and sold chewing gum and energy drinks to survive. Choi said that very bad things happened to him as a child and that he was sold to someone. Choi's life was about to change dramatically as a result of a simple audition."
