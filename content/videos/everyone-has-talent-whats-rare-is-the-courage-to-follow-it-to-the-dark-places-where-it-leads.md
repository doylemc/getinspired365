summary: "Ed Sheeran moved to London in 2008 to play gigs, starting off in very small venues, playing every day. In 2009, he played 312 gigs. Ed said that he read an interview with James Morrison that said that James had done 200 gigs in a year, so Ed said he wanted to beat him on this number. When he ran out of money, he left his flat he was renting and started 'sofa surfing' around London, he has been doing this ever since, even after he signed his deal. Talent will only get you so far.."
