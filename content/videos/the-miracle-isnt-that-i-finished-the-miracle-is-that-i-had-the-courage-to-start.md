summary: "Told from the point-of-view of runners from all walks of life, the film explores the inspiration and motivation that modern cultures associate with running. On the surface, the reasons people run seem obvious; health, stress, competition to name a few. But what if there is a deeper, more intrinsic compulsion that connects people who choose to run for enjoyment regardless of genetic, ethnic, socioeconomic, religious or physical differences?"
