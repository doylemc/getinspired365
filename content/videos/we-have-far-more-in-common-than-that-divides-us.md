description: "We have far more in common than that divides us. - Jo Cox quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Christina Grimmie, 49 party-goers in Orlando and British MP Jo Cox were all tragically killed by a madman with a gun. It would be easy to lose all faith in humanity after these senseless acts, however newspapers are still dominated with stories of love - Christina Grimmie's brother risking his own life to save her's. Great Compton Street packed with LGBT supporters & Jo Cox's husband calling on us to 'fight against the hatred that killed her'. It's up to us to make sure love prevails over hate."
