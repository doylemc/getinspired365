summary: "It's a day that comes to everyone. The day you commit to becoming more, to achieve more, and to be the person you want to be. The moment when the path to a better version of yourself becomes clear. It's about the courage, commitment and dedication to challenge yourself in everything you do, and to not accept your limits."
