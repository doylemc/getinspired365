summary: "Ten years after losing his sight at 22, Mark Pollock became the first blind person to race to the South Pole. The psychological impact of that success put blindness behind him - he moved on with his life and became engaged to his girlfriend Simone. But four weeks before the wedding, a terrible fall left Mark paralysed from the waist down. This emotional, fascinating film tells the remarkable story of a couple rebuilding their lives and searching for a cure for spinal injury."
