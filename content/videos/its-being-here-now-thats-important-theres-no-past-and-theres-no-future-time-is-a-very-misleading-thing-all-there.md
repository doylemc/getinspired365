title: "It's being here now that's important. There's no past and there's no future. Time is a very misleading thing. All there is ever, is the now. We can gain experience from the past, but we can't relive it; and we can hope for the future, but we don't know if there is one."
author: "George Harrison"

summary: "You need not delete your social networks or destroy your cell phones, the message is simple, be balanced, be mindful, be present, be here."
