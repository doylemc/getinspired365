summary: "Once upon a time, Pete Gustin dreamed of becoming a voiceover artist. But at age 8, he was diagnosed with macular degeneration, a medical condition that results in loss of vision, turning him legally blind. At 21, a New York-based agent told him heâ€™d never make it in the business; his blindness prevented him from reading lines. Fast-forward 15 years. Gustin has done voiceovers for the Super Bowl, an international ad campaign for Sony PlayStation and even daytime TV."
