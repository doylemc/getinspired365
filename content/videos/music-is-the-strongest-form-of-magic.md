summary: "Inspired by the imagination of P.T. Barnum, The Greatest Showman is an original musical that celebrates the birth of show business & tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation. This scene was the final throw of the dice to get the project financed and agreed. The gamble paid off and the film has become one of the great movie musicals!"
