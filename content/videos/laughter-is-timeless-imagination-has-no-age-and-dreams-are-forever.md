summary: "'Last month JacksGap launched a project to collaborate with as many people as possible on one video. We asked our audience to send in video messages via Skype answering the question - 'What do you love?' We received over 2500 submissions from twenty different countries in fifteen different languages. We'd like to thank everyone who took part in this project. It's incredibly exciting for us to work with you the audience to produce a different type of video. We're really proud of the result! '"
