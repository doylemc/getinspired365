title: "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages."
author: "Friedrich Nietzsche"
description: "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. - Friedrich Nietzsche quotes from GetInspired365.com"
summary: "Do marriage vows seem to mean as much today as they used to? If you've heard anything about the increase in divorce rates, you may wonder. Bill & Glad are ignoring the trends. More than ever the vows they made 50 years ago are being tested. In sickness and in health, in good times and in bad, the promise they are keeping is a true example of what love is."
