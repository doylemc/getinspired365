summary: "These days it is so easy to feel insecure about our appearance. Whether it is because of the mean comment that comes our way or the photoshopped image we see in magazines, it can be so easy to feel self conscious about our body. When was the last time you felt comfortable in your own skin? The purpose of this video is to inspire you to be more comfortable and confident in yourself. Beauty is not about what you don't have, but about being comfortable in your own skin"
