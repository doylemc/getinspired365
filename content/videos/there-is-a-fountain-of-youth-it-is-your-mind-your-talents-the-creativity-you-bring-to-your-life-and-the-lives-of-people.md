summary: "Hal Lasko, better known as Grandpa, worked as a graphic artist back when everything was done by hand. His family introduced him to the computer and Microsoft Paint long after he retired. Now, Grandpa spends ten hours a day moving pixels around his computer and creating brilliant computer art. His work is a collision of pointillism and 8-Bit art. Oh, and he is almost blind."
