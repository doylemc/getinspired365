title: "Keep moving. Stop & rest if need be. But never move backwards. You can't change the past, all you can do is learn from it. Learn from your mistakes & come back next time stronger. So make a goal. Dig deep run, jump, swim, & fly into that uncertain but brilliant future. Take a chance, & go right."
