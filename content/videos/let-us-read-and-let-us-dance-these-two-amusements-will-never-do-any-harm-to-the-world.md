summary: "In early 2003, he quit his job to go wandering around Southeast Asia until the money ran out. A few months into his trip, he and his friend, Brad Welch, were taking pictures on the streets of Hanoi when Brad said “Hey, why don’t you stand over there and do your stupid dance. I’ll record it.” Matt did it, and he thought it looked pretty funny, so he kept on doing it everywhere he went. That turned out to be a very good idea. Matt has turned his dancing jig into his full time career!"
