summary: "The Free Hugs Campaign is a social movement involving individuals who offer hugs to strangers in public places. The hugs are meant to be random acts of kindness - selfless acts performed just to make others feel better. International Free Hugs Month is celebrated on the first Saturday of July and continues until August 1st. The campaign in its present form was started in 2004 by an Australian man known only by the pseudonym 'Juan Mann'. "
