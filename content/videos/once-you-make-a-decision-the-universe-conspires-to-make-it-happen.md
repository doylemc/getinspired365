summary: "The video was filmed in the shanty towns of Manila, Philippines, and follows the life of two boys growing up in the cities' poverty. The two are sadly forced to go their separate ways, as one manages to escape the cities' underbelly and succeeds in street-dancing, whereas the other becomes trapped in a life of gang violence, drug crime and a murder, eventually resulting in his death."
