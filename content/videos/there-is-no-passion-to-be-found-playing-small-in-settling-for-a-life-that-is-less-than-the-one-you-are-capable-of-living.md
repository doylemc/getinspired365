summary: "Getting tossed around by shorebreak and slammed into the sand day after day is a rough go; Clark Little wouldn't have it any other way. In fact, for the North Shore local, it's all in a good day's work. But the Waimea addict didn't grow up snapping shots with his father's camera like so many photographers do. He instead set out to capture his longtime stomping grounds when his wife came home with a framed photograph of Waimea shorebreak, an image he figured he would be able to easily replicate. "
