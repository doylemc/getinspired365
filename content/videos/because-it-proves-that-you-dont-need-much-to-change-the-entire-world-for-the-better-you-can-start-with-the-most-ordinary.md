summary: "Streets Ice Cream proves how generous people really are. Through a live experiment, customers were told that their ice cream had already been paid for by the customer before them! People were very surprised and excited by their free ice cream! Customers were then given the opportunity to pay for the next person's ice cream and bring a moment of joy to someone they had never met before! 100% of people said yes... and the Streets Chain of Joy was created!"
