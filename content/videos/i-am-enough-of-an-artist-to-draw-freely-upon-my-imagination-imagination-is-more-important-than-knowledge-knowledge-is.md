summary: "Nirvan Mullick went to buy a door handle for his car, & met this 9 year old boy, who had spent his summer building this elaborate cardboard arcade inside his dad’s used auto part store. Caine invited Nirvan to play, & he couldn’t pass up his FunPass deal. Nirvan shared Caine’s amazing story & created this video. Since the video was created over $240,000 has been donated to Caine’s Scholarship Fund, & Nirvan has started the Imagination Foundation to foster creativity in more kids like Caine"
