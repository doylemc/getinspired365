summary: "This video attempts to convey the importance and beauty of simple moments we experience day-to-day. We often obsess over things or experiences that excite us, or anger us, or sadden us, but the truth is that most of our time living is made up of simple moments that pass by quickly without us giving them any attention. This video draws our focus to those moments and reminds us to be grateful for our lives in their entirety."
