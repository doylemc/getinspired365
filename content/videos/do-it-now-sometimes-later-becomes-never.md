summary: "On 16th May 2011, James Ketchell reached the summit of Mount Everest.  Nearly a year prior to that, James had rowed single handed across the Atlantic Ocean.  Three years prior to that, he was recovering from a serious motorcycle accident that left him with broken legs, a severely broken and dislocated ankle and the prognosis that he was likely to suffer a permanent walking impairment and would certainly not be able to continue the active physical lifestyle he had enjoyed up to that point."
