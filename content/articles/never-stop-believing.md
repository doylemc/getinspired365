As I have written before, my wife has suffered (and continues to suffer - on and off) with anxiety.

I was blown away by the reaction of the post that I shared on Getinspired365 and Medium a couple of months ago. I ended up receiving close to ~200 emails, with the vast majority describing their own battle with anxiety - either personally, or regarding a loved one. The common theme that ran through almost all these emails was around what practical steps could I [the person emailing] do to help improve my own anxiety, or the anxiety of a loved one.

I have spent some time giving this subject a bit of thought and here are my own thoughts around this subject. This is just from my perspective and what may work for my wife and I may not work for the reader but I hope some of the information contained within this article proves to be of some use. As ever, I am more than happy to join in the conversation in the comments below.

First, Anxiety is often misunderstood. It can be incredibly debilitating and the worst thing about it is that it can come on from no where and without reason. As I previously said, the best way I can describe it is that youâ€™re faced with someone who is just paralysed with fear, unable to communicate effectively and on the verge of total panic.

Anxiety is both a mental illness, and a physical illness. It can cause chest pains - so severe that you may think you are experiencing a heart attack. It can cause you to be boiling hot, or freezing cold and can make sleep either an impossibility or can leave you feeling chained to your bed through lethargy.

The horrible thing about anxiety is that it often feels like it is controlling you and taking over your life - your personal relationships, your work - everything. And when you are going through a particularly bad spell you just can't imagine yourself getting better, and perhaps you won't unless you take some action.

### So what can you do?
First things first, as the partner make sure you involve yourself in their anxiety. And if you are the one suffering then see if a partner/loved one can take on this role. As the supporter, find out how they are feeling and try and notice trends and triggers because chances are they won't - catalogue these so you can begin to identify triggers, and therefore avoid or address them. Communicate on the days they are feeling better to try and identify things that you, the partner, did well and did not do so well and conversely the sufferer may want to volunteer up this information should they feel like they're in a good place and capable of doing so.
